# rust-doctor

`rust-doctor` scans a Cargo workspace with 62 curated rules and scores it out of
100. It runs locally, reaches no network and uploads nothing. The scan runs
`cargo clippy` inside the workspace, which executes its build scripts and
procedural macros, so scan trusted local paths only.

## The ceiling decides what to fix first

Every rule carries a tier, and the worst tier present caps the score however
clean the rest is:

| Worst tier present | Its dimension caps at | The whole score caps at |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | 20 | 40 |
| P1 | 50 | 65 |
| P2 | 75 | uncapped |
| P3 | uncapped | uncapped |

One P0 finding makes a hundred P3 repairs worth nothing. Read `audit.score.worst_tier`
and `audit.score.applied_ceiling` first, and repair what sets the ceiling.

Under the ceiling the score is a density, not a tally. The model is `core-v4`,
published as `audit.score.model`, and each dimension scores
`round(100 * exp(-D / lambda))`. D counts one distinct site per diagnostic, an
error weighing two, a warning one and an info nothing, each site weighed by the
tier of its rule, P3 one and every tier above doubling the one below, and each
rule discounted by the false-positive rate the pinned corpus measured for it,
over the size of what was scanned: Clippy, the source detectors and the
structural pass divide by the workspace's production kilolines, floored at
two, so the same finding costs a small crate more than a large one, while the
manifest and repository rules divide by nothing, since a workspace has one
`Cargo.toml` whatever its size. Lambda is the density at which a dimension
falls to 37, tightest on security and most forgiving on reliability. The five
dimensions combine at weights 4 for security, 3 for reliability and 2 each for
maintainability, performance and dependencies, and the result lands in one of
three bands: 75 and above reads
`Great`, 50 to 74 `Needs work`, below 50 `Critical`. A clone family is one site
whatever its `related` array names, and findings outside production code stay
visible and cost nothing.

The report names the shortlist itself. `audit.score.projected_rule_ids` is the
three rules worth repairing first, in the order to repair them: each is the
rule that gives the most points back on top of the ones before it, through the
ceilings, discounted by its measured rate, so the rule holding a ceiling comes
first. `audit.score.projected_after_top_three` is the score they are worth.
`audit.score.withheld_rule_ids` is what the corpus found wrong more often than
right. Take that ranking as given rather than rebuilding one from the
categories.

## After changing Rust code

```bash
rust-doctor . --json --scope baseline --base main 2>/dev/null
```

Baseline scope reports only what the change introduced. Repair every finding it
returns before committing, since each one is yours.

## Auditing a workspace

```bash
rust-doctor . --json 2>/dev/null
```

Record `audit.score.value` as the baseline, then work the shortlist:

1. Read each diagnostic in `diagnostics`. It carries its `code`, `message`,
   `help`, `path`, `span` and `occurrences`, and, when Clippy wrote one, a
   `suggestion` with the `replacement` for the span and its `applicability`;
   only `machine-applicable` is safe to paste unread. Applying it is yours to
   do: the tool never writes into a workspace it scans, so there is no fix
   subcommand and none is coming. `policy.rules` carries
   the `tier` and `category` of every rule the scan ran. A diagnostic at
   severity `info` is shown and costs nothing, such as a print in a binary
   target.
2. Open the flagged file and read around the span. Report no finding you have
   not read the source of.
3. Read [references/expert-review.md](references/expert-review.md) and apply it
   to the file you just opened. A flagged line usually sits next to unflagged
   problems the catalog has no rule for, and finding those is the reason an
   agent runs this rather than reading the score alone.
4. Fix the root cause rather than the flagged symptom, and show the before and
   after:

```
#### rust_doctor::source::disabled_tls_verification (security, P0)
src/client.rs:42, inside `fn connect()`, public API
- before: `.danger_accept_invalid_certs(true)`
- after:  `.danger_accept_invalid_certs(cfg!(test))`
- why:    every caller of this client accepted forged certificates in production.
```

5. Rescan. The pass is done when the new value reaches
   `projected_after_top_three`, or when you name which projected rule fell short
   and why. A value that did not move means the ceiling did not move: check
   `worst_tier` again.

Close on the score delta, the dimensions that moved, the fixes applied with
their `file:line`, what expert review found beyond the catalog, and what you
left.

## Explaining or tuning a rule

`rust-doctor rules list --json` prints every catalogued rule with its category,
producer, default level, tier and help, which is what a diagnostic's `code`
resolves against. Explain the rule from its help before offering to switch it
off: most findings people dislike are real.

There is no suppression comment. A rule is turned off for one run with
`--rule <id>=off` or `--category <name>=<level>`, and durably in
`rust-doctor.toml` at the workspace root. Prefer the narrowest control, and
prefer fixing the code: `#[allow]` attributes are themselves catalogued findings
when they carry no reason.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `rust-doctor . --json` | Full structured report, the shape every step above reads |
| `rust-doctor . --json --scope baseline --base main` | Only what the branch introduced |
| `rust-doctor . --json --scope files --base main` | Only the files the branch touched |
| `rust-doctor rules list --json` | The catalog the binary shipped with |
| `rust-doctor . --rule <id>=off` | Run without one rule |
| `rust-doctor . --category <name>=error` | Raise or lower a whole category |
| `rust-doctor . --blocking <none\|error\|warning>` | The level that makes the run exit non-zero |

Use `--json` for anything you parse. `--verbose` is for a human reading a
terminal, and a run with neither flag on a terminal opens an interactive report
that an agent cannot drive. If the binary is not on `PATH`, prefix with
`npx rust-doctor@latest`.
